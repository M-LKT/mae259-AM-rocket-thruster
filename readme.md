# Goals for today

- Discussing Rocket Sizing Theory

- Determining Sizing Constraints for Rocket
    - Vehicle size (thrust)
        - Fully Fueled Mass
            - 1200 + 100 + 100 = 1400 t = 1,400,000 kg
        - Lenght
            - Length 50 m
            - Diameter 9 m

        - 0.3 rad/s^2

    - Machine print size (dimensions)
        - LaserTec 65
            - 28.9 in
            - 25.6 in
            - 22 in
            - 1322 

- Chemsitry
    - Propellants
    - Pressure

- Engine Contour Sizing
    - Chamber contour
    - Parabolic nozzle
    - Estimate for heat transfer

# Notes

Types of propellants

## Fuels (when with LOX)
- Kerosene (250-350s)
- Liquid Methane (300-380s)
- Liquid Hydrogen (400-460s)

- UDMH [Hydrazine] (250-300s)
    - monoprop (150-200s)

## Oxidizers
- Liquid Oxygen
- H202
- N20

- N2H4 [Dinitrogen Tetroxide]

# Assumptions about modeling rocket engine
- Isentropic process
- Use the Area-Mach equation to correlate gas properties throughout nozzle as a function of cross-sectional area (depends on isentropic gamma ratios)

- exhaust velocity equation
